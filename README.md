$ npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

* Run npm install to install the dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install
```

* By default, this project is configured to be used with a [PostgreSQL Dababase](https://www.postgresql.org). You can
  configure it in the project's env file

## Technologies used

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) is a free and open-source high-level programming language developed by
  Microsoft that adds static typing with optional type annotations to JavaScript.
  It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript.

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) is a cross-platform runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine used
  in running JavaScript codes on the server.
  It allows for installation and managing of dependencies and communication with databases.

* [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications.
  It uses modern JavaScript, is built with TypeScript (preserves compatibility with pure JavaScript) and combines
  elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) is a free and open-source relational database management system (
  RDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.
  PostgreSQL features transactions with atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability (ACID) properties, automatically
  updatable views, materialized views, triggers, foreign keys, and stored procedures.

* [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io) is an ORM that can run in NodeJS, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic, React
  Native, NativeScript, Expo, and Electron platforms and can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7,
  ES8).
  Its goal is to always support the latest JavaScript features and provide additional features that help you to develop
  any kind of application that uses databases - from small applications with a few tables to large scale enterprise
  applications with multiple databases.

* [Swagger](https://swagger.io) is a suite of tools for API developers from SmartBear Software and a former
  specification upon which the OpenAPI Specification is based.

* [MinIO](https://min.io) is a high-performance, S3 compatible object store. It is built for
  large scale AI/ML, data lake and database workloads. It runs on-prem and
  on any cloud (public or private) and from the data center to the edge. MinIO
  is software-defined and open source under GNU AGPL v3.

* [Socket.IO](https://socket.io) is an event-driven library for real-time web applications.
  It enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers
